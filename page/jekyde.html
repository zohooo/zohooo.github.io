<p>Jekyde is a static blog builder, server and writer in Node.JS. Using Jekyde, You could write your blog in Markdown and LaTeX easily.</p>
<p>The main differences between Jekyde and other similar tools are the following three features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take care of conflicts between Markdown and LaTeX: You only need to write LaTeX formulas as $...$ and $$...$$. No need to put them inside backquotes, and no worry about \{...\} and a_1b_1 broken by markdown.</li>
<li>Include a live blog writer inside browser: You could write you markdown + LaTeX articles in browser, and get the live preview of results by marked and MathJax. When you save articles, Your blog website will be regenerated at once.</li>
<li>You may write your blog posts in local computer, and push Jekyde-built website to GitHub pages. Also you may deploy Jekyde to your Node.JS server, and write your blog posts in browser, just as using WordPress.</li>
</ol>
<p>
